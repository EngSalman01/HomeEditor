# HomeEditor
Welcome to homeEditor!

homeEditor is a project that allows users to easily edit and customize their home layouts. With homeEditor, users can drag and drop furniture and other items to create a virtual representation of their home and try out different design ideas.

To get started with homeEditor, simply launch the website on your desktop/laptop. You will be presented with a blank canvas where you can begin adding and arranging items to create your desired home layout. Use the toolbar at the left of the screen to access a variety of walls, windows and doors that you can add to your layout.

Once you are happy with your layout, you can download a pdf file or an image to share it with friends to get their feedback. 

Currently, homeEditor only includes walls, windows, and doors in its selection of items that can be added to a home layout. However, we are working on expanding the selection of items to include a wider variety of furniture and decor. Stay tuned for updates! In the meantime, please feel free to experiment with the available items and see how they can be used to create different home layouts.

We hope you enjoy using HomeEditor and creating beautiful home layouts!
